.PP
Create a new conda environment from a list of specified packages. To use the created environment, use 'source activate envname' look in that directory first.  This command requires either the \fB\-n\fR NAME or \fB\-p\fR PREFIX option.
.SH OPTIONS
.SS "positional arguments:"
.TP
package_spec
Packages to install or update in the conda
environment.
.SS "optional arguments:"
.TP
\fB\-h\fR, \fB\-\-help\fR
Show this help message and exit.
.TP
\fB\-y\fR, \fB\-\-yes\fR
Do not ask for confirmation.
.TP
\fB\-\-dry\-run\fR
Only display what would have been done.
.TP
\fB\-f\fR, \fB\-\-force\fR
Force install (even when package already installed).
.TP
\fB\-\-file\fR FILE
Read package versions from the given file. Repeated
file specifications can be passed (e.g. \fB\-\-file\fR=\fI\,file1\/\fR
\fB\-\-file\fR=\fI\,file2\/\fR).
.TP
\fB\-\-no\-deps\fR
Do not install, update, remove, or change
dependencies. This WILL lead to broken environments
and inconsistent behavior. Use at your own risk.
.TP
\fB\-\-only\-deps\fR
Only install dependencies.
.TP
\fB\-m\fR, \fB\-\-mkdir\fR
Create the environment directory if necessary.
.TP
\fB\-C\fR, \fB\-\-use\-index\-cache\fR
Use cache of channel index files, even if it has
expired.
.TP
\fB\-\-use\-local\fR
Use locally built packages.
.TP
\fB\-\-offline\fR
Offline mode, don't connect to the Internet.
.TP
\fB\-\-no\-pin\fR
Ignore pinned file.
.TP
\fB\-c\fR CHANNEL, \fB\-\-channel\fR CHANNEL
Additional channel to search for packages. These are
URLs searched in the order they are given (including
file:// for local directories). Then, the defaults or
channels from .condarc are searched (unless
\fB\-\-override\-channels\fR is given). You can use 'defaults'
to get the default packages for conda, and 'system' to
get the system packages, which also takes .condarc
into account. You can also use any name and the
\&.condarc channel_alias value will be prepended. The
default channel_alias is http://conda.anaconda.org/.
.TP
\fB\-\-override\-channels\fR
Do not search default or .condarc channels. Requires
\fB\-\-channel\fR.
.TP
\fB\-n\fR ENVIRONMENT, \fB\-\-name\fR ENVIRONMENT
Name of environment.
.TP
\fB\-p\fR PATH, \fB\-\-prefix\fR PATH
Full path to environment prefix.
.TP
\fB\-q\fR, \fB\-\-quiet\fR
Do not display progress bar.
.TP
\fB\-\-copy\fR
Install all packages using copies instead of hard\- or
soft\-linking.
.TP
\fB\-k\fR, \fB\-\-insecure\fR
Allow conda to perform "insecure" SSL connections and
transfers. Equivalent to setting 'ssl_verify' to
\&'false'.
.TP
\fB\-\-update\-dependencies\fR, \fB\-\-update\-deps\fR
Update dependencies. Overrides the value given by
`conda config \fB\-\-show\fR update_deps`.
.TP
\fB\-\-no\-update\-dependencies\fR, \fB\-\-no\-update\-deps\fR
Don't update dependencies. Overrides the value given
by `conda config \fB\-\-show\fR update_deps`.
.TP
\fB\-\-channel\-priority\fR, \fB\-\-channel\-pri\fR, \fB\-\-chan\-pri\fR
Channel priority takes precedence over package
version. Overrides the value given by `conda config
\fB\-\-show\fR channel_priority`.
.TP
\fB\-\-no\-channel\-priority\fR, \fB\-\-no\-channel\-pri\fR, \fB\-\-no\-chan\-pri\fR
Package version takes precedence over channel
priority. Overrides the value given by `conda config
\fB\-\-show\fR channel_priority`.
.TP
\fB\-\-clobber\fR
Allow clobbering of overlapping file paths within
packages, and suppress related warnings.
.TP
\fB\-\-show\-channel\-urls\fR
Show channel urls. Overrides the value given by `conda
config \fB\-\-show\fR show_channel_urls`.
.TP
\fB\-\-no\-show\-channel\-urls\fR
Don't show channel urls. Overrides the value given by
`conda config \fB\-\-show\fR show_channel_urls`.
.TP
\fB\-\-download\-only\fR
Solve an environment and ensure package caches are
populated, but exit prior to unlinking and linking
packages into the prefix.
.TP
\fB\-\-json\fR
Report all output as json. Suitable for using conda
programmatically.
.TP
\fB\-\-debug\fR
Show debug output.
.TP
\fB\-\-verbose\fR, \fB\-v\fR
Use once for info, twice for debug, three times for
trace.
.TP
\fB\-\-clone\fR ENV
Path to (or name of) existing local environment.
.TP
