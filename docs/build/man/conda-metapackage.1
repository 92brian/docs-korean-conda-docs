.PP
Tool for building conda metapackages.  A metapackage is a package with no
files, only metadata.  They are typically used to collect several packages
together into a single package via dependencies.
.PP
NOTE: Metapackages can also be created by creating a recipe with the necessary
metadata in the meta.yaml, but a metapackage can be created entirely from the
command line with the conda metapackage command.
.SH OPTIONS
.SS "positional arguments:"
.TP
name
Name of the created package.
.TP
version
Version of the created package.
.SS "optional arguments:"
.TP
\fB\-h\fR, \fB\-\-help\fR
Show this help message and exit.
.TP
\fB\-\-no\-anaconda\-upload\fR
Do not ask to upload the package to anaconda.org.
.TP
\fB\-\-token\fR TOKEN
Token to pass through to anaconda upload
.TP
\fB\-\-user\fR USER
User/organization to upload packages to on
anaconda.org
.TP
\fB\-\-build\-number\fR BUILD_NUMBER
Build number for the package (default is 0).
.TP
\fB\-\-build\-string\fR BUILD_STRING
Build string for the package (default is automatically
generated).
.TP
\fB\-\-dependencies\fR [DEPENDENCIES [DEPENDENCIES ...]], \fB\-d\fR [DEPENDENCIES [DEPENDENCIES ...]]
The dependencies of the package. To specify a version
restriction for a dependency, wrap the dependency in
quotes, like 'package >=2.0'.
.TP
\fB\-\-home\fR HOME
The homepage for the metapackage.
.TP
\fB\-\-license\fR LICENSE_NAME
The license of the metapackage.
.TP
\fB\-\-summary\fR SUMMARY
Summary of the package. Pass this in as a string on
the command line, like \fB\-\-summary\fR 'A metapackage for
X'. It is recommended to use single quotes if you are
not doing variable substitution to avoid
interpretation of special characters.
.TP
\fB\-\-entry\-points\fR [ENTRY_POINTS [ENTRY_POINTS ...]]
Python entry points to create automatically. They
should use the same syntax as in the meta.yaml of a
recipe, e.g., \fB\-\-entry\-points\fR
bsdiff4=bsdiff4.cli:main_bsdiff4 will create an entry
point called bsdiff4 that calls
bsdiff4.cli.main_bsdiff4().
