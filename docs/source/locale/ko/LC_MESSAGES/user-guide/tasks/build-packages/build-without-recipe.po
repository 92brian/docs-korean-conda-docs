"You can use conda build to build packages for Python to install rather "
"than conda, by using ``setup.py bdist_conda``. This is a quick way to "
"build packages without using a recipe, but it has limitations. The script"
" is limited to the Python version used in the build, and it is not as "
"reproducible as using a recipe. We recommend using a recipe with conda "
"build."
