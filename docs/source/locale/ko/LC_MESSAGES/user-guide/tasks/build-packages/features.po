"Features are a way to track differences in two packages that have the "
"same name and version. For example, a feature might indicate a "
"specialized compiler or runtime, or a fork of a package. The canonical "
"example of a feature is the mkl feature in Anaconda Accelerate. Packages "
"that are compiled against MKL, such as NumPy, have the mkl feature set. "
"The mkl metapackage has the mkl feature set in track_features, so that "
"installing it installs the mkl feature. Feature names are independent of "
"package names---it is a coincidence that mkl is both the name of a "
"package and the feature that it tracks."

"Think of features as belonging to the environment the package is "
"installed into, not the package itself. When a feature is installed, "
"conda automatically changes to a package with that feature if it exists. "
"For example, when the mkl feature is installed, regular NumPy is removed "
"and the NumPy package with the mkl feature is installed.  Enabling a "
"feature does not install any packages that are not already installed, but"
" all future packages with that feature that are installed into that "
"environment will be preferred."

"It is a good idea to create a metapackage for track_features. If you add "
"track_features to a package that also has versions without that feature, "
"then the versions without that feature will never be selected, because "
"conda will always add the feature when it is installed from the "
"track_features specification of your package with the feature."
