"Some corporate environments use proxy services that use Man-In-The-Middle"
" (MITM) attacks to sniff encrypted traffic. These services can interfere "
"with SSL connections such as those used by conda and pip to download "
"packages from repositories such as PyPI."

"If you encounter this interference, you should set up the proxy service's"
" certificates so that the ``requests`` package used by conda can "
"recognize and use the certificates."

"For cases where this is not possible, conda-build versions 3.0.31 and "

"WARNING: This option causes your computer to download and execute "
